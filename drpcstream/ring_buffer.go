// ringBuffer is a bounded single-producer / single-consumer FIFO queue for
// assembled packet data. It sits between manageReader (producer, calls
// Enqueue) and the application goroutine (consumer, calls Dequeue/Done).
//
// Buffers are obtained from a shared BufferPool. Enqueue copies data into a
// pooled buffer; Dequeue returns that buffer's data and advances the tail
// immediately, and Done releases the buffer back to the pool. Keeping the
// pool behind Dequeue/Done means the consumer does not need to know whether
// the queue is backed by a pool or by fixed buffers.
//
// After Close, Dequeue drains any queued messages before returning the close
// error. This ensures graceful shutdown (KindClose/KindCloseSend) delivers
// all buffered data to the consumer.
