// spscQueue is a bounded single-producer / single-consumer queue for byte
// slices. It is implemented as a ring buffer with mutex+cond synchronization.
//
// The producer calls Enqueue to copy data into the next write slot. If the
// queue is full, Enqueue blocks until a slot is freed or the queue is closed.
//
// The consumer calls Dequeue to get a reference to the next read slot. The
// returned slice is valid until Done is called. Done advances the read
// pointer and recycles the slot for reuse by the producer.
//
// Close sets an error and wakes all blocked waiters. After Close, Enqueue
// is a no-op and Dequeue returns the close error.
//
// Slots are pre-allocated and reused. Each slot's backing array grows via
// append to fit incoming data, then stays at its high-water mark, avoiding
// per-message allocation in steady state.
